# covid19-DEATH RATE

## ABOUT THE DATA
  Data was imported from 'our world in data' research site. it was in an excell form, downloaded and analysed
  it cut across all countries across the continents affected by covid19 virus but my area of focus was centered 
  on Africa as a continent and Nigeria as a country. It consist of over 161,000 rows and numerous columns
  but the columns was narrowed to the columns stated bellow based on the findings needed for this project
  the columns makes up:
    1. Date:
    2. Continents
    3. Location
    4. Population
    5. Total_cases
    6. Total_deaths
    7. Total_vaccinations
    
    
## DATA ANALYSIS USING SQL COMMANDS
 using SQL to explore and clean the data. data was not deleted during cleaning as every row in the set was valid and valuable 
 after importing the data, i used the join tools to join the vaccination and death rates because i have 
 seperated them when analysing it on the excel sheet.
 
 ## PURPOSE 
 The purpose for carrying out this project is,
  1. To know the total percentage of death rate of covid-19 across the continents with ratio to how they are vaccinated.
  2. To know the country with the highest death rate and the effect of vaccination on these death rate.
  3. To know the death rate in Nigeria with respect to the number of cases discovered.
  4. to know the impact of vaccination on the death rate across the continents, in Africa and Nigeria.
  
  ##QUERIES
  The project includes several SQL queries to analyse the covid-19 death rate data. you can find the quries above in the SQL file uploaded above
